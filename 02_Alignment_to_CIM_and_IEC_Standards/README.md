# Graph Model based on CIM/IEC
This folder present a refined graph data model to align with CIM/IEC standards. This is done by considering major critical components that has been documented in the standards. To better model data for the reliability of the MV cable network and failure data, a combination of three datasets is needed. First, since we track the failure of cables, asset records are required (as specified in IEC 61968-4). Second, components will be maintained, repaired, and some will be built. In such cases, maintenance and construction records (as specified in IEC 61968-6) are required. Third, the cable system is connected through substations, which have joints or junctions, and subsections that belong to IEC 61968-11. Hence, our graph data model will take into consideration these standards to ensure correctness and support scalability. Three files are presented, detailed descriotions of how previous graph model is aligned to CIM/IEC, the CYPHER model to implement the proposal and basic queries to fetch the stored data.
